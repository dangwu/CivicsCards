### About 

**Civics Cards** is an iOS app available in the App Store. The app contains flash cards for studying for the the U.S. citizenship interview. I made this app because every other one out there was infested ads or required in-app purchases. My wife just needed a simple app that would read out the 100 official questions in random order and reveal answers with a tap!
